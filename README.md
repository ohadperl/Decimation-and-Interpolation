# Decimation-and-Interpolation
Signals and Systems Project at BIU about Decimation and Interpolation

Project Overview:

This project was completed as part of the Signals and Systems course. The objective was to implement signal processing techniques and demonstrate their functionality. Specifically, I worked on decimation and interpolation for audio signals.

The project involves:

1. Applying decimation to reduce the sampling rate of a given audio file.
2. Performing interpolation to restore the original sampling rate.
3. Verifying and showcasing the accuracy and effectiveness of the processing.

During the project, we demonstrated three interpolation methods: Zero-Order Hold (ZOH), First-Order Hold (FOH), and Zero-Padded Interpolation.
Each method was applied according to specific conditions that needed to be considered beforehand.
The results showed that all three methods performed well, meeting the expected requirements and achieving accurate signal reconstruction.

The results demonstrate how these techniques can be used effectively in digital signal processing.
