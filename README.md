# Decimation-and-Interpolation
Signals and Systems Project at BIU about Decimation and Interpolation

Project Overview
This project was completed as part of the Signals and Systems course. The objective was to implement signal processing techniques and demonstrate their functionality. Specifically, I worked on decimation and interpolation for audio signals.

The project involves:

1. Applying decimation to reduce the sampling rate of a given audio file.
2. Performing interpolation to restore the original sampling rate.
3. Verifying and showcasing the accuracy and effectiveness of the processing.
4. 
The results demonstrate how these techniques can be used effectively in digital signal processing.
